# Quantum-Algorithm-Lab
In Phys 422 in spring 2025, I conducted a final project on quantum computation algorithm (Grover's algorithm) using Qiskit runtime service. The provided PFD summerizes my lab report on the running algorithm on Qiskit runtime service. The paper consists of 4 pages. To get an overview, please read the abstract below first.

## Abstract
This paper consists of three major sections: introduction to qiskit, overview of Grover’s algorithm, and its analysis on the experiment. We first walk through what IBM Qiskit offers to a client what it can be executed and built on a real quantum hardware. It is essential to follow the workflow pattern to implement one’s desired
circuit and execute on a quantum hardware available on cloud service. On second, the overview of Grover’s algorithm explains its procedures and necessary circuit
components. On third, by implementing Grover’s algorithm, one can run it on Qiskit and see the increased probabilities by giving increasing number of the amplitude amplification operations.
